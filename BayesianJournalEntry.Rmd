# Discrete Probability Distribution using Bayesian, which uses subjective probability which describes beliefs about unknown quantities.And the method used is through probability distribution. a Spinner is used as a example which is divided into several regions and opt for various outcomes.
#Package Used- "TeachBayes" (available on CRAN).The Special functions for Bayes'rule are-  Learning baout a proportion and a mean and comparing two proportions.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library (TeachBayes)
# Define a spinner with five regions: regions
regions <- c(2,2,2,2,2)
spinner_plot(regions)
spinner_probs(regions)


# Plot the spinner
spinner_plot(regions)

# Show the probability distribution
spinner_probs(regions)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Bayes'rule identifies possible models and contains prior probabilities. For executing collect the data , think of likelihood an dchance of getting the data for each model. Then find the posterior probability for finding the knowledge about model. 
# Define a spinner with five regions: regions
regions <- c(2,2,2,2,2)
spinner_plot(regions)
spinner_probs(regions)


# Plot the spinner
spinner_plot(regions)

# Show the probability distribution
spinner_probs(regions)
# Define new spinner: regions
regions <- c(2, 2, 4)

# Simulation 1000 spins: spins
spins <- spinner_data(regions, 1000)

# Graph the spin data using bar_plot()
bar_plot(spins)

# Construct frequency table of spins
table(spins)

# Find fraction of spins equal to 2
mean(spins == 2)

# Find mean spin value
mean(spins)



# Create the vector of models: Model
Model <- c("Spinner A", "Spinner B")

# Define the vector of prior probabilities: Prior
Prior <- c(1/2, 1/2)

# Define the vector of likelihoods: Likelihood
Likelihood <- c(1/2, 1/6)

# Make a data frame with variables Model, Prior, Likelihood: bayes_df
bayes_df <- data.frame(Model, Prior, Likelihood)

# Compute the posterior probabilities
bayesian_crank(bayes_df)

bayes_df
prior_post_plot
prior_post_plot (bayes_df)
# Display the vector of models: Model
Model <- c("Spinner A", "Spinner B")

# Define the vector of prior probabilities: Prior
Prior <- c(0.75, 0.25)

# Define the vector of likelihoods: Likelihood
Likelihood <- c(1/2, 1/6)

# Make a data frame with variables Model, Prior, Likelihood: bayes_df
bayes_df <- data.frame(Model, Prior, Likelihood)

# Compute the posterior probabilities
bayesian_crank(bayes_df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
